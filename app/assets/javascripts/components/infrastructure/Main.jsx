        bio : "Corky Collier has been Executive Director of the Columbia Corridor Association since 2004, combining his eclectic business, environmental and political experience. Corky works on a wide variety of issues affecting the economic prosperity of the largest economic corridor in Oregon, including transportation, land use, and natural resources. He helped establish and manages two business education programs: ResourceFull Use and the Groundwater Protection Program. From 1987 to 1998, Corky co-owned a whitewater outfitting company in northern California. During those years, he led efforts to combine business and environmental concerns into cooperative action. Dam construction and operation, government regulations and fees, law enforcement and development were targets for reform. Significant successes were achieved at the local, state and federal levels. In 1998, Corky managed a ballot measure campaign to protect small business interests. By working with environmental organizations, neighborhoods and businesses, the campaign won 65% of the vote. He went on to work in media and public outreach. He serves on the Portland Freight Committee, Columbia Slough Watershed Council, and Brownfield Redevelopment Coalition. He holds degrees in Biology and Geography from the University of Texas. Old awards include Eagle Scout; new awards include the Columbia Slough Watershed Council Leadership Award. Corky lives in North Portland within view of the St. Johns Bridge and Forest Park with his wife Sara and son Henry." ,
